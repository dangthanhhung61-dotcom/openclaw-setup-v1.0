## 🗺️ Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Method 1 — npm release

Open your terminal and run this single command (works on macOS, Linux & Windows — needs Node.js 24 LTS):

```bash
npx create-openclaw-bot
```

It downloads the wizard, starts the local server, and opens the Setup UI in your browser at **http://127.0.0.1:51789**.
> The npm release may not include 5.16.12 yet. Use Method 2 for the latest GitHub installer.

### 2️⃣ Method 2 — Run the newest GitHub source (recommended for 5.16.12)

Use this if you specifically want the newest code directly from GitHub:

```bash
npx --yes github:dangthanhhung61-dotcom/openclaw-setup-2026-9-6
```

> **Git is required for this method.** Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and make sure the `git` command works in your terminal first; otherwise npm cannot download the GitHub repository.

### 3️⃣ Method 3 — Manual clone (for developers)

For contributors who want the full source. Run each line in order:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dangthanhhung61-dotcom/openclaw-setup.git
cd openclaw-setup
npm install
npm start
```

Then open **http://127.0.0.1:51789** if the browser doesn't open by itself.

> ⚠️ `npm install` / `npm start` only work **inside the cloned `openclaw-setup` folder**. If you used either npx method, simply run the same npx command again when you want to reopen Setup.

### 🔁 Reopen the UI later

Run the recommended command again. Setup detects and reopens your existing project:

```bash
npx create-openclaw-bot
```

### ⬆️ Update to the newest version

Click **Update** in the **top-right corner of the Setup interface**. It downloads the newest version and restarts the UI automatically; the current browser tab reconnects on its own.

## 📋 System Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24 LTS** (required) — the Setup wizard itself runs on Node, so it's needed for **both** Docker and Native modes. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
  OpenClaw is pinned to **2026.9.6**, which requires **Node.js 24.16.0+ (24.x)** or **26.1.0+**. Node.js 22 and 25 are not supported. The generated OpenClaw Docker image uses `node:24-slim`.
- **Git**: Installed and available in your environment PATH.
- **Docker Desktop** (recommended, for the bot runtime): Docker Compose V2. [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- **Windows + Docker**: use the WSL2 backend and enable Developer Mode or launch the installer from an Administrator terminal to create the `.openclaw` link.

## 🚀 Step-by-step Setup Guide

> First time? Follow these in order — no terminal needed beyond opening the UI.

**1. Open the Setup UI** — run the install command above; the dashboard opens in your browser.

**2. Pick OS & run mode** — first make sure [Node.js 24 LTS](https://nodejs.org/) is installed (the wizard runs on Node — needed for **both** modes). Then open the **Setup** tab, choose your OS and the run mode:
- **Docker** (recommended) — isolated, and lets you create **multiple projects/bots**. Also install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- **Native** — lighter, runs the bot directly on the host (no Docker needed).

**3. Project path & name** — enter a folder path and a project name (example name: `bot`), then click **Install**. Example paths:
- Windows: `D:\bot`
- macOS: `/Users/<you>/bot`
- Linux: `/home/<you>/bot`

**4. Log in to 9Router** — click **Open 9Router website**, then log in with the default password **`123456`**.

**5. Create an API key (9Router)** — in **Endpoints**, create a new API key. Then open your project folder → `openclaw.json` → scroll to the **`models`** section → paste the key into the empty `apiKey` field and save.

**6. Connect a provider (9Router)** — go to **Providers**, pick the provider you want; it connects automatically.

**7. Create the routing combo (9Router)** — go to **Combos**, create a combo named exactly **`smart-route`** and add the models it should route to.

**8. Create your bot** — back in the Setup UI, choose a channel, fill in the bot info + your personal info, then click **Create bot**.

**9. Restart & test** — restart the bot container, then message your bot to test it. 🎉

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>How do I start or stop the bot?</b></summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Where do I edit the bot's persona and instructions?</b></summary>
You can edit them directly in your browser. Go to the <b>Bot</b> tab, scroll down to the <b>Bot file tree</b> section, and select the file you want to edit (e.g., `SOUL.md` or `AGENTS.md`). Click <b>Save</b> to apply changes instantly.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I change the AI model configuration later?</b></summary>
